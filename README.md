  - My name is Cao Hoang Phuoc Bao, was born in 2005 in a lovely small town at Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam.    
  
  - I am currently studying at VKU University. A place where people united together working toward their dreams, and bring magics from imagination to real life.

  - if there are words that express myself, it would be:  Extraverted, Enthusiastic, Intuitive, Decisively, and sometime can be a little Over-Emotional-ist ðŸ˜‰

  - Dog Lover.
