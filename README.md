  - My name is Cao Hoang Phuoc Bao, born in 2005 in a lovely small town in Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam.  
  
  - I am currently studying at VKU University. A place where people united together, working toward their dreams, and bring magic from imagination to real life.

  - If there are words that express myself, they would be: Enthusiastic, Intuitive, Decisive, and sometimes a little Over-Emotional_ist. ðŸ˜‰

  - Dog Lover.
